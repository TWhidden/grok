They need to deliver packages to 12 cities with varying distances (ranging from 50 to 500 miles) and different delivery time windows. Each truck has different fuel efficiency rates, and fuel costs vary by location. The company wants to minimize total cost while ensuring all deliveries are completed on time. Additionally, some trucks require maintenance after certain mileage, and driver work-hour regulations must be considered. Calculate the optimal delivery strategy and explain the reasoning behind each decision, including alternative approaches that were considered and why they were rejected.";
